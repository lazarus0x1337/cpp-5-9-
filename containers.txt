Templated containers, iterators, algorithms ? :

-> Containers are the data structures used to store objects 
    and data according to the requirement 
    Each container is implemented as a template class 
    that also contains the methods to perform basic operations on it.



about ex01 in cpp08 :

Last but not least, it would be wonderful to fill your Span using a range of iterators.
Making thousands calls to addNumber() is so annoying. Implement a member function
to add many numbers to your Span in one call.

If you don’t have a clue, study the Containers. Some member
functions take a range of iterators in order to add a sequence of
elements to the container.

explanation :
In C++, the insert function is a member function available in several 
standard containers, such as std::vector, std::list, std::deque, and std::set. 
It allows you to add elements to a container at a specified position.

template <class InputIterator>
iterator insert(iterator pos, InputIterator first, InputIterator last);

Positioning: The insert function takes an iterator pos that indicates where the new element(s) should be inserted.




Stack in C++ STL
Stacks are a type of container adaptors with LIFO(Last In First Out) type of working

Purpose of a Stack
LIFO Principle: A stack is fundamentally designed to follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
This access pattern is inherently limited to the top element of the stack.


** What Does "Not Iterable" Mean?

Lack of Iterators:
Unlike other STL containers, 
std::stack does not provide member functions that return iterators
(such as begin() and end()). 
Iterators are essential for iterating through the elements of a container using standard
 loops and algorithms (like std::for_each, std::copy, etc.).

Access Limitations:
In a stack, you can only access the top element using top()
and you can add or remove elements from the top using push() and pop().
This design aligns with the LIFO principle but restricts how you can traverse 
or manipulate the elements in the stack.

syntax : 
** --> template <class Type, class Container = deque<Type> > class stack;

about deque :
Double-ended queues are sequence containers with the feature of expansion and contraction on both ends. 
They are similar to vectors, but are more efficient in case of insertion and deletion of elements.
Unlike vectors, contiguous storage allocation may not be guaranteed. 
Double Ended Queues are basically an implementation of the data structure double-ended queue. 
A queue data structure ----allows insertion only at the end and deletion from the front----


*** The c in c.begin() and c.end() is a container_type defined in the stack class:
```
public:
    typedef _Container                               container_type;
protected:
    container_type c;
```
used to store the stack’s elements.
The c member is protected, meaning it can be accessed by the class itself 
and any derived classes (like MutantStack), but not directly by external code.
